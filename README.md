# Math Rush

COMP 204 - Programming Studio Project
A hyper-casual Unity game where you control a horde of runners, make quick math-based decisions at gates, avoid deadly traps, and defeat a boss at the end of each level.

## Gameplay

- Guide your group of runners through levels filled with math gates and obstacles.
- Choose between two gates—each applies a different math operation (+, –, ×, ÷) to your runner count.
- Avoid rotating blades and other traps that remove runners from your horde.
- Reach the end and battle the boss: each remaining runner deals 1 damage.
- Survive with as many runners as possible to maximize your score.
